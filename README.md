- 👋 Hi, I’m @thumper118
- 👀 I’m interested in penteration testing. My friend has lost close to $100k usd b/c his ex knows a blackhat hacker and the cops don't seem all to interested.
 So ive learned alot thanks to NetworkChuck on youtube also on NetworkChuck.com  and also my teacher Irfan@ehacking.net 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning kali linux. Man you guys have it alot easier than we did in the 90's no matter white or blackhat this is alot easier  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making new programs to adapt products like my wacom one tablet and photoshop that you could use on linux. Also a program like 
photosherlock(great program) but with better facial recognition. There are just too many scams and catfishing going on
- 📫 How to reach me...
